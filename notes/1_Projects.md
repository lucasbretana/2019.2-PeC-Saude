## PeC - Sa√∫de
- quite close the industry of health around here
	* **LifeMed**, we shall talk a lot about them

- will shall work with industry specif problems (not necessary a _actual_ problem, but a common one)
	* in a controlled space like the academy

- do note that most of the projects are close to the _infusion bombs_ problems
	* it is the main work of the __LifeMed__ company
		+ infusion medicine

- we shall work in teams for a specif project

### Teams
- a group of N people
	* one leader

- we shall specify the activities to be performed for each member of the team
	* in that we should write a schedule 
		+ ..yet, we know that only true fact about the schedule is that it will fail..

- the leader should manage the team working and report to the professors
	* let's try to make this task more close a industry project
	* not to be exactly but close enough to that

- next steps:
	* today: group formation and project definition
	* next: tech discussion
	* next: seminar 1
	* next: field trip
	* next: vacation :P
	* next: seminar 2
	* next: tech discussion
	* next: seminar 3

### Projects - Behavior of Intravenous Flow
- the infusion of intravenous medicine can be done in N different ways
	* and that is many different reasons

- so, there is no equipment to control the infusion bombs
	* the group developed a simulator for that
	* this simulator has verified using previous information on real cases
- detect knowledge about infusion profiles

#### Project 1A (2 students)
- use techniques of smart agents to detect knowledge about infusion profiles
	* that should be done without the need to inform that the infusion is being done
	* like a GoogleFit app it should detect when the infusion starts 

- main steps
	* detect the infusion start
	* the rate of infusion
	* when it stops

- why is that so important?
	* doctors cannot be sure if the prescription of medicine was appropriate delivered

#### Project 2A
- use statists to gain info about the behavior of the electric signals to create profile of infusion

- we could analyze the behavior of the infusion and use statists analyses on that
	* once we have a profile of use we can make many inferences about future uses
	* we could detect and log every patient variants on the infusion so the doctor can analyze it properly


#### Project B - explore the use of Algorithms and Techniques of Supervision to Evaluate the Obstruction in Infusion Bombs
- there are two main techniques for infusion, some thing like
	* high: hydrated the patient when given him the medicine (European school)
	* low: concentrated medicine (American school)

- the obstruction problem, maybe the biggest problem
	* can be caused by the patient (when moving)
	* the nurse can forget to simply open the valve

- the bombs use a pressure sensors to detect possible obstruction
	* note that the sensors __do not__ touch the liquid
	* it is very common to give a false positive (something like 90% false positive)
	* how can that be on the marked? the market make the rules, and they cannot do it any better '-'

- it is important to note that most the liquids that are infused into the patient is saline
	* i.e. a single discharge on the sensors could kill the patient (so don't let it touch the liquid)

##### Project 1B (2 students) - MINE
- apply techniques of smart systems to detect anomalies on the infusions

##### Project 2B (2 students)
- analyse algorithms to detect anomalies on the infusions
	* this one can continue or use as base the teacher's work

#### Project C - explore the DataSet of projects A n' B, infer correlation of the bombs infusion's behavior
- uses date of projects A and B

##### Project 1C (2 students)
- apply smart system techniques or other stuff

#### Project D - evaluate the impact of medicine deliver throw intravenous infusion
- analyze
	* vital signals
	* concentration of medicine delivered
	* types of drugs
	* patient characteristics

- fonts
	* lots of links..

- one of the biggest problems will be to model the data to give it a learning algorithm

##### Project 1D (3 students)
- evaluate the DataSets of vital signals and define a set of rules and informations about the patient's treatment

##### Project 2D (3 students)
- evaluate the DataSets of hospital's registers about the equipments and environment that lead to death

#### Project E - tools to correlate the collect signals by the multi parametric monitor
- data to be used
	* history of vital signals

- the LifeMed company already have one of those multi parametric monitors

##### Project 1E (3 students)
- evaluate the DataSets produced by the monitors multi parametric
	* define a set of rules and informations about the treatment of the patients that could inform a closure

#### Project F - analyse collected data by the LifeMed monitoring central
- the LifeMed have this central monitoring system
	* we could use all that data to try and tell useful information to the doctor 
	* and others stakeholders of the patients

- useful info to be used
	* collected by the infusion bombs
	* collected by the multi parametric monitors
	* parameters created and used by the professionals of health to generate alerts
	* relation of foreseen treatment and expected results
	* ... 

##### Project 1F (3 students)
- define a systematic with the LifeMed people, organize and build a data model
