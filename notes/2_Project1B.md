## Review
### Project B - explore the use of Algorithms and Techniques of Supervision to Evaluate the Obstruction in Infusion Bombs
- there are two main techniques for infusion, some thing like
	* high: hydrated the patient when given him the medicine (European school)
	* low: concentrated medicine (American school)

- the obstruction problem, maybe the biggest problem
	* can be caused by the patient (when moving)
	* the nurse can forget to simply open the valve

- the bombs use a pressure sensors to detect possible obstruction
	* note that the sensors __do not__ touch the liquid
	* it is very common to give a false positive (something like 90% false positive)
	* how can that be on the marked? the market make the rules, and they cannot do it any better '-'

- it is important to note that most the liquids that are infused into the patient is saline
	* i.e. a single discharge on the sensors could kill the patient (so don't let it touch the liquid)

#### Project 1B (2 students) - MINE
- apply techniques of smart systems to detect anomalies on the infusions

## Next to do
- read the article of Felipe on ERAD of 2019/18

- look for the paper of the ... tesis

- download the DataSets
	* apparently it's all a bunch of txt files
		+ lots of cat, grep, pipe, cut and etc
